	The width issue: 
	<ul>
		<li>Inconsistencies between the result of applying styles (most notably the width) to various PF components</li>
		<li>No apperent way to set the width of some components without a workaround</li>
	</ul>

	In order to help visualize the problem, the border style of the components has been set to solid black
